This is an extension built from the frustrations and ideas that an avid programmer had while learning to code.

This extension aims to help you while learning coding and technology related skills by automating mundane tasks, such are; shortcuts, changing a website video player background colour (to dark or light), and hiding & showing elements that can be distracting or just take up too much screen space.

Currently we only support the website called CodeWithMosh, but more websites will be added along as we develop this extension.

Thank you so much for being a user and please feel free to checkout the github repo here https://github.com/owsamahajjar/CodeLearn_ChromeExtension if you have any ideas to share.
